            <h3 class="text-center">Who</h3>
            <p>Currently I'm a junior high student with plenty of hobbies. Though I have no formal training or education regarding computer science, I still manage to write mediocre code. My hobbies do mainly revolve around computer science but I also enjoy reading, design and of course movies and televison. I also manage to hold down a part time job at a grocery store, it's not an ideal job but I need funds to pay for my hobbies. </p>

        <div class="col-md-4">
            <h3 class="text-center">What</h3>
            <p>It's somewhat difficult to explain what I exactly do. In short, I'm a hobbiest. I make simple software and websites that usually turn out worse than I expect. I mainly work with: Python, HTML, CSS, JS, NodeJS. Lately I've been writing awful Dart/Flutter code to build an app. I'm also trying to work with Linux/bash more and I want to do more sysadmin work.</p>

        <div class="col-md-4">
            <h3 class="text-center">Why</h3>
            <p>I honestly don't know why I program and write these awful pieces of software. I suppose it's a hobby but I take it a little too seriously. I truly do enjoy writing code. It's a good hobby and it occupies my time.</p>

            <h3>NodeJS Twitter Bot</h3>
            <h4>I wrote a simple NodeJS Twitter bot as an attempt to get used to the twit package. It turned out decent enough, and I managed to test out what I wanted to test. I do enjoy working with the twit package but I don't really see it as useful. Recently I shut down the Twitter Account associated with the bot. As you can imagine the project was pretty much a mess but the general point was made and I've learnt all I need.</h4>

            <h4>Currently I'm working on a console app that can find a Alberta Students Number/ID. To go further in depth, All students in Alberta,Canada have a student ID. There is a site made by the Albertan Government to find and request student ID's. What my work does is retrieve student ID's from the site through the console. It's currently written in Python and I do plan to build a Kivy UI around it and implement many more features.</h4>

            <h3>School Project</h3>
            <h4>About three months ago I developed a site for a school project. The project was to make a informational pamphlet or brochure explaining a diet. I was given the Pescetarian diet and I built a site to explain what it's about and how to effectively become pescetarian. The site itself is awful, there's no denying it. I'm not proud of the work I did. It was however, one of the first sites i've ever made.</h4>
