                    Frank first assumes a role as a pilot for Pan American Airways. Posing as a pilot is great for frank; he can travel for free, he can gain respect and admiration, but most importantly, no one ever questions him as a pilot. By changing his age and his credentials he easily plays the role and no one questions his position or knowledge. Frank manages to pick up some of the lingo and pass off as a decent pilot, he’s perfectly capable of holding a conversation with other pilots and maintains the illusion for a very long time.

                    Eventually his knowledge is tested and his position is questioned. One day, after deadheading to Miami, he gets stopped and questioned by the FBI. Frank is told that there’s been some questions as to whether or not he is indeed a real pilot. Luckily Frank manages to convince the FBI agents that he is authentic by having his pilot friends verify that he is indeed who he says he is. After this experience he decides to stop pretending to be a pilot and eventually he moves to New Orleans and starts over.

                <h2>Doctor</h2>
                <p>
                    When Frank is trying to establish residency in New Orleans, he goes to The River Bend apartment complex. On the application form he lists his occupation as “Medical Doctor”. He later goes into depth about his position stating he’s a pediatrician. The job frank choose was a great choice, he gets to hold a respected position as a doctor for children, since River Bend is adult only complex, no one will ask him to examine them. Later Frank’s confronted by an actual pediatrician who offers to give frank a tour of the hospital he’s employed at. Initially Frank declines the offer, but later he decides he should go to study. During the tour of the facility, Frank is intrigued and decides to visit often to study.  He’s later offered a temporary position, Frank accepts and begins work.

                    The job is great for Frank. He’s admired by all the staff, he’s earning a decent wage. However one small problem persists; Frank isn’t a real doctor. He has absolutely no idea what he’s doing. Thankfully, the job is somewhat hands of. Later, inevitably he’s faced with a challenge. A nurse urges him to help with a blue baby(A baby not getting oxygen). Frank doesn’t even know what a blue baby is.
